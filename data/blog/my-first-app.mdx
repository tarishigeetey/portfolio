## **Step 1: The Idea – Turning a Thought into a Project**

Music is a powerful companion—it reflects our emotions, enhances our experiences, and sometimes, even heals us. However, finding the right song for a specific mood isn’t always easy.

This sparked an idea:  
🔹 **What if an app could analyze emotions and generate playlists that match your mood?**

That’s how **Muzik** was born. The goal? **Emotion-driven music recommendations.** The app would take **text-based input**, detect the user’s mood, and fetch a matching playlist from **Spotify’s vast music library**.

💡 **Core Concept:**  
1️⃣ Detect the **user’s mood** using AI-powered sentiment analysis.  
2️⃣ **Map emotions to music genres** intelligently.  
3️⃣ Fetch **personalized playlists** from **Spotify’s API**.

---

## **Step 2: Designing the System – Breaking Down the Architecture**

Before jumping into coding, I focused on **how Muzik would function** as a system.

### **Tech Stack Choices**

I wanted a **modern, scalable, and efficient system**:

- **Frontend:** ReactJS _(Fast, interactive, and ideal for music apps)_
- **Backend:** Java Spring Boot _(Robust, secure, and well-suited for APIs)_
- **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL) _(Scalable & reliable for user preferences and history)_
- **APIs:**
  - **Hugging Face** (Emotion detection & sentiment analysis)
  - **Spotify API** (Song search & playlist generation)

### **System Overview**

🔷 **User Input** → "I'm feeling nostalgic and calm."  
🔷 **Emotion Detection** → Hugging Face AI detects _"nostalgic & calm"_.  
🔷 **Genre Mapping** → App matches this to _Soft Rock, Acoustic, Indie_.  
🔷 **Spotify API Call** → Fetches songs from these genres.  
🔷 **Personalized Playlist** → Displayed on the UI.

📌 **Goal:** Keep it **fast, responsive, and intuitive**.

## **Step 3: Database & Data Flow – Structuring the Data**

For any AI-driven application, **structured data** is crucial. I designed the **database schema** with **three key tables**:

### **🎵 Database Schema**

| Table Name | Description                                                 |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `emotions` | Stores emotion types (e.g., Happy, Sad, etc.)               |
| `moods`    | Maps emotions to specific moods (e.g., Energetic, Calm)     |
| `genres`   | Maps moods to specific music genres (e.g., Pop, Rock, Jazz) |

### **Data Flow**

1️⃣ **User sends a mood text** → Frontend sends request to backend.  
2️⃣ **Spring Boot processes request** → Calls Hugging Face API for sentiment analysis.  
3️⃣ **Backend maps emotions to moods** → Looks up data in `moods` table.  
4️⃣ **Backend maps moods to genres** → Looks up data in `genres` table.  
5️⃣ **Spotify API fetches songs** → Backend makes an authenticated request to Spotify.  
6️⃣ **Database stores user interactions** → Logs playlists for future recommendations.  
7️⃣ **Frontend displays results** → A dynamic, scrollable playlist appears.

💡 **Why Supabase?**

- PostgresSQL’s **relational structure** is perfect for handling **users & moods**.
- **Scalability** – Future versions can include **user login, playlist history, and custom mood tracking**.

## **Step 4: UI/UX – Keeping it Simple & User-Friendly**

A good product isn’t just about functionality—it **must feel intuitive** to the user. I designed Muzik’s UI with **simplicity** in mind:

### **🎨 Key UI/UX Decisions**

✅ **Minimalist layout** – Focus on **mood input & playlist display**.  
✅ **Left-aligned form** – Quick, effortless text input.  
✅ **No clutter** – Users get **results instantly**.  
✅ **Dark & light mode toggle** – Enhances accessibility.  
✅ **Mobile-responsive** – Works seamlessly across devices.

### **Wireframe Sketches (Initial Concepts)**

1️⃣ **Mood Input Box** – A simple text field for users to enter how they feel.  
2️⃣ **Playlist Section** – A clean, scrollable list of suggested songs.  
3️⃣ **Emotion Visualization (Optional Future Feature)** – A small AI-powered graph showing mood trends.

I used **Tailwind CSS** to ensure fast, modern, and responsive styling.

## **Step 5: Backend System – Building with Java Spring Boot**

With the **frontend wireframes ready**, I built the **backend API** in **Spring Boot**.

### **🔧 Backend API Workflow**

- **Controller Layer**: Handles API requests.
- **Service Layer**: Calls Hugging Face & Spotify APIs.
- **Repository Layer**: Connects to Supabase for data storage.

### **🔑 Key Backend Challenges & Solutions**

✅ **OAuth with Spotify API** → Handled **token refresh & session management** securely.  
✅ **Handling AI Requests Efficiently** → Cached Hugging Face API results for faster responses.  
✅ **Real-Time API Calls** → Optimized query speed using **Azure Redis Cache**.

💡 **Key Learning:** Designing **efficient API calls** was crucial in ensuring fast performance.

---

## **Step 6: Testing & Deployment – Making It Production-Ready**

A **good developer tests before shipping.** 🚀 I ensured Muzik was **bug-free and scalable** before deployment.

### **🧪 Testing Strategy**

✔️ **Unit Testing** – Used **JUnit & Mockito** for backend services.  
✔️ **API Testing** – Ensured Hugging Face & Spotify integrations worked reliably.  
✔️ **Performance Testing** – Simulated multiple API calls to check response times.

### **🚀 Deployment Strategy**

- **Backend:** Deployed using **Docker, Azure Redis, & Azure Container Apps**.
- **Frontend:** Hosted on **Vercel** with **GitHub Actions for CI/CD**.

---

## **Step 7: The Final Version & Next Steps**

After weeks of **development, testing, and refining**, Muzik was **ready for launch.** 🚀

📌 **Current Status:**  
✅ **Live & Working** – Beta version launched.  
✅ **10-15 User Testing** – Gathering feedback for improvements.  
✅ **Refactoring & Enhancements** – Continuous improvements in progress.

📌 **Future Plans:**  
🔹 **User Accounts & Preferences** – Personalized playlist history.  
🔹 **More AI-driven Features** – Fine-tuning **emotion-to-music recommendations**.  
🔹 **Multi-language Support** – Expanding usability globally.

## **Final Thoughts – What I Learned**

Building **Muzik** was a **fun, challenging, and rewarding** experience.

### **💡 Key Takeaways:**

✔️ **Start with a clear plan** – A solid architecture saves time.  
✔️ **APIs are powerful, but tricky** – OAuth, rate limits, and security matter.  
✔️ **User Experience is key** – A beautiful UI makes functionality shine.  
✔️ **Testing & Deployment make a difference** – A project isn’t done until it runs smoothly in production.

Would I do it again? **Absolutely.** 🎧🔥
