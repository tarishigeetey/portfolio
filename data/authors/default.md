**A Full Stack Developer passionate about building scalable and efficient applications, with evolving tech.**

Previously, as a **Full-Stack Developer** at **IBM**, developing enterprise applications using Java, Spring Boot, ReactJS, and Angular. I designed scalable microservices, optimized databases, and integrated Kafka, leading to improved efficiency and customer satisfaction. I also received the Star Performer Award twice.

Beyond work, Iâ€™ve built multiple personal projects, designed modular architectures, and streamlined development workflows. I also trained students in Java programming and represented Madhya Pradesh at IISF 2019.

I strive to keep innovating and contributing to impactful full-stack solutions. Looking ahead, I aim to continue building high-performance full-stack applications and contributing to impactful technology solutions.
